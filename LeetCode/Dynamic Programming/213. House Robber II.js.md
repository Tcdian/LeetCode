## [213. House Robber II](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/)

###

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle**. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight_ **without alerting the police**.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3
```

#### Constraints:

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
-   `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

#

### 方法: 动态规划（Dynamic Programming）

#### 代码

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var rob = function (nums) {
    if (nums.length === 1) {
        return nums[0];
    }
    return Math.max(robRange(nums, 0, nums.length - 2), robRange(nums, 1, nums.length - 1));

    function robRange(nums, start, end) {
        const dp = new Array(end - start + 1);
        dp[0] = nums[start];
        dp[1] = Math.max(dp[0], nums[start + 1]);
        for (let i = start + 2; i <= end; i++) {
            dp[i - start] = Math.max(dp[i - start - 1], dp[i - start - 2] + nums[i]);
        }
        return dp[end - start];
    }
};
```
