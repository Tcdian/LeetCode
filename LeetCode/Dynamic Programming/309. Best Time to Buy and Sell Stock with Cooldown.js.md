## [309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/)

###

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

-   After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).

**Note**: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

#### Example 1:

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: prices = [1]
Output: 0
```

#### Constraints:

-   `1 <= prices.length <= 5000`
-   `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`

### 方法一：动态规划（Dynamic Programming）

#### 代码

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function (prices) {
    const hold = new Array(prices.length);
    const empty = new Array(prices.length);
    hold[0] = -prices[0];
    hold[1] = Math.max(hold[0], -prices[1]);
    empty[0] = 0;
    empty[1] = Math.max(empty[0], hold[0] + prices[1]);
    for (let i = 2; i < prices.length; i++) {
        hold[i] = Math.max(hold[i - 1], empty[i - 2] - prices[i]);
        empty[i] = Math.max(empty[i - 1], hold[i - 1] + prices[i]);
    }
    return empty[prices.length - 1];
};
```

#### 复杂度

-   时间复杂度: _O_ (n)。

-   空间复杂度: _O_ (n)。
