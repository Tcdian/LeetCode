## [913. Cat and Mouse](https://leetcode.com/problems/cat-and-mouse/)

###

A game on an **undirected** graph is played by two players, Mouse and Cat, who alternate turns.

The graph is given as follows: `graph[a]` is a list of all nodes `b` such that `ab` is an edge of the graph.

The mouse starts at node `1` and goes first, the cat starts at node `2` and goes second, and there is a hole at node `0`.

During each player's turn, they **must** travel along one edge of the graph that meets where they are. For example, if the Mouse is at node 1, it **must** travel to any node in `graph[1]`.

Additionally, it is not allowed for the Cat to travel to the Hole (node 0.)

Then, the game can end in three ways:

-   If ever the Cat occupies the same node as the Mouse, the Cat wins.
-   If ever the Mouse reaches the Hole, the Mouse wins.
-   If ever a position is repeated (i.e., the players are in the same position as a previous turn, and it is the same player's turn to move), the game is a draw.

Given a `graph`, and assuming both players play optimally, return

-   `1` if the mouse wins the game,
-   `2` if the cat wins the game, or
-   `0` if the game is a draw.

#### Example 1:

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/17/cat1.jpg" width="300">

```
Input: graph = [[2,5],[3],[0,4,5],[1,4,5],[2,3],[0,2,3]]
Output: 0
```

#### Example 2:

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/17/cat2.jpg" width="200">

```
Input: graph = [[1,3],[0],[3],[0,2]]
Output: 1
```

#### Constraints:

-   `3 <= graph.length <= 50`
-   `1 <= graph[i].length < graph.length`
-   `0 <= graph[i][j] < graph.length`
-   `graph[i][j] != i`
-   `graph[i]` is unique.
-   The mouse and the cat can always move.

#### Solution: 动态规划 (Dynamic Programming)

```js
/**
 * @param {number[][]} graph
 * @return {number}
 */
var catMouseGame = function (graph) {
    const n = graph.length;
    const MOUSE_WIN = 1;
    const CAT_WIN = 2;
    const DRAW = 0;
    const dp = Array.from(new Array(n), () => Array.from(new Array(n), () => new Array(2 * n + 1).fill(-1)));
    return dfs(1, 2, 0);

    function dfs(mouse, cat, turns) {
        if (dp[mouse][cat][turns] < 0) {
            if (turns >= 2 * n) {
                dp[mouse][cat][turns] = DRAW;
            } else if (mouse === 0) {
                dp[mouse][cat][turns] = MOUSE_WIN;
            } else if (mouse === cat) {
                dp[mouse][cat][turns] = CAT_WIN;
            } else if (turns % 2 === 0) {
                //mouse
                let ans = CAT_WIN;
                for (let i = 0; i < graph[mouse].length; i++) {
                    let next = dfs(graph[mouse][i], cat, turns + 1);
                    if (next !== CAT_WIN) {
                        ans = next;
                    }
                    if (ans === MOUSE_WIN) {
                        break;
                    }
                }
                dp[mouse][cat][turns] = ans;
            } else {
                //cat
                let ans = MOUSE_WIN;
                for (let i = 0; i < graph[cat].length; i++) {
                    if (graph[cat][i] === 0) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    let next = dfs(mouse, graph[cat][i], turns + 1);
                    if (next !== MOUSE_WIN) {
                        ans = next;
                    }
                    if (ans === CAT_WIN) {
                        break;
                    }
                }
                dp[mouse][cat][turns] = ans;
            }
        }
        return dp[mouse][cat][turns];
    }
};
