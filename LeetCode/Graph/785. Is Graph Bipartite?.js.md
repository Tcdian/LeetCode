## [785. Is Graph Bipartite?](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-graph-bipartite/)

###

There is an **undirected** graph with `n` nodes, where each node is numbered between `0` and `n - 1`. You are given a 2D array `graph`, where `graph[u]` is an array of nodes that node `u` is adjacent to. More formally, for each `v` in `graph[u]`, there is an undirected edge between node `u` and node `v`. The graph has the following properties:

-   There are no self-edges (`graph[u]` does not contain `u`).
-   There are no parallel edges (`graph[u]` does not contain duplicate values).
-   If `v` is in `graph[u]`, then `u` is in `graph[v]` (the graph is undirected).
-   The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes `u` and `v` such that there is no path between them.

A graph is **bipartite** if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets `A` and `B` such that **every** edge in the graph connects a node in set `A` and a node in set `B`.

Return `true` if and only if it is **bipartite**.

#### Example 1:

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/21/bi2.jpg" width="222" />

```
Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.
```

#### Example 2:

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/21/bi1.jpg" width="222" />

```
Input: graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: We can partition the nodes into two sets: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
```

#### Constraints:

-   `graph.length == n`
-   `1 <= n <= 100`
-   `0 <= graph[u].length < n`
-   `0 <= graph[u][i] <= n - 1`
-   `graph[u]` does not contain `u`.
-   All the values of `graph[u]` are **unique**.
-   If `graph[u]` contains `v`, then `graph[v]` contains `u`.

### 方法

#### 代码

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} graph
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isBipartite = function (graph) {
    const initial = 0;
    // -1 和 1 表示不同集合
    const bipartite = new Array(graph.length).fill(initial);
    for (let i = 0; i < graph.length; i++) {
        if (bipartite[i] === initial && !dfs(i, 1)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;

    function dfs(current, sign) {
        if (bipartite[current] !== initial) {
            return bipartite[current] === sign;
        }
        bipartite[current] = sign;
        for (let i = 0; i < graph[current].length; i++) {
            if (!dfs(graph[current][i], -sign)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

#### 复杂度

-   时间复杂度: _O_ (n + m)，其中 `n` 和 `m` 分别是无向图的点数和边数。

-   空间复杂度: _O_ (n)。
