## [141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

###

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.**

Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

#### Example 1:

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png" width="300" />

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

#### Example 2:

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png" width="141" />

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

#### Example 3:

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png" width="45" />

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

#### Constraints:

-   The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10`<sup>`4`</sup>`]`
-   `-10`<sup>`5`</sup>` <= Node.val <= 10`<sup>`5`</sup>
-   `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

**Follow up**: Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?

### 方法：双指针 (Two Pointers)

#### 代码

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var hasCycle = function (head) {
    let fast = head;
    let slow = head;
    while (fast !== null && fast.next !== null) {
        fast = fast.next.next;
        slow = slow.next;
        if (fast === slow) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
};
```

#### 复杂度

-   时间复杂度: _O_ (n)。

-   空间复杂度: _O_ (1)。
