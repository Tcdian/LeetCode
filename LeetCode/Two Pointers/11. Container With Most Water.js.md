## [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

###

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

#### Example 1:

<img src="https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg" width="600" />

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

#### Constraints:

-   `n == height.length`
-   `2 <= n <= 10`<sup>`5`</sup>
-   `0 <= height[i] <= 10`<sup>`4`</sup>

#

#### Solution: 双指针 (Two Pointers)

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} height
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxArea = function (height) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = height.length - 1;
    let ans = 0;
    while (left < right) {
        if (height[left] < height[right]) {
            ans = Math.max(ans, (right - left) * height[left]);
            left++;
        } else {
            ans = Math.max(ans, (right - left) * height[right]);
            right--;
        }
    }
    return ans;
};
```
