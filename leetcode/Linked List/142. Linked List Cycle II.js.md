## [142. Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)

###

Given the `head` of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to (**0-indexed**). It is `-1` if there is no cycle. **Note that** `pos` **is not passed as a parameter**.

**Do not modify** the linked list.

#### Example 1:

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png" width="450">

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

#### Example 2:

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png" width="201">

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

#### Example 3:

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png" width="65">

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

#### Constraints:

-   The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10`<sup>`4`</sup>`]`.
-   `-10`<sup>`5`</sup>` <= Node.val <= 10`<sup>`5`</sup>`
-   `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

#### Solutionï¼š

```js
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
var detectCycle = function (head) {
    let fast = head;
    let slow = head;
    while (fast !== null && fast.next !== null) {
        fast = fast.next.next;
        slow = slow.next;
        if (slow === fast) {
            let patrol = head;
            while (patrol !== slow) {
                patrol = patrol.next;
                slow = slow.next;
            }
            return patrol;
        }
    }
    return null;
};
```
