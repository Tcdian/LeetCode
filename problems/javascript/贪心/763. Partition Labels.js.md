###

You are given a string `s`. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.

Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: s = "eccbbbbdec"
Output: [10]
```

#### Constraints:

-   `1 <= s.length <= 500`
-   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

#

#### 方法：贪心

```js
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var partitionLabels = function (s) {
    const record = new Array(26);
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        record[s.codePointAt(i) - 97] = i;
    }
    let index = 0;
    let result = [];
    while (index < s.length) {
        let left = index;
        let right = record[s.codePointAt(index) - 97];
        while (index !== right) {
            index++;
            right = Math.max(right, record[s.codePointAt(index) - 97]);
        }
        result.push(right - left + 1);
        index++;
    }
    return result;
};
```
