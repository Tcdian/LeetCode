###

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

#### Example 1:

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

#### Constraints:

-   `1 <= n <= 45`

#

#### 方法：动态规划

```ts
function climbStairs(n: number): number {
    const dp: number[] = new Array(n + 1);
    dp[0] = dp[1] = 1;
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```
