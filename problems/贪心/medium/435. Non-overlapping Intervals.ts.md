###

Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

#### Constraints:

-   `1 <= intervals.length <= 10`<sup>`5`</sup>
-   `intervals[i].length == 2`
-   `-5 * 10`<sup>`4`</sup>` <= starti < endi <= 5 * 10`<sup>`4`</sup>

#

#### 方法一：贪心

```ts
function eraseOverlapIntervals(intervals: number[][]): number {
    intervals.sort(([start1], [start2]) => start1 - start2);
    let rightBound = intervals[0][1];
    let result = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        if (intervals[i][0] < rightBound) {
            rightBound = Math.min(rightBound, intervals[i][1]);
            result += 1;
        } else {
            rightBound = intervals[i][1];
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```
