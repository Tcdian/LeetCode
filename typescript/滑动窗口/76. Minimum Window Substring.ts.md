###

Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return the **minimum window substring** of s such that every character in t (**including duplicates**) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string `""`.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

#### Constraints:

-   `m == s.length`
-   `n == t.length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 10`<sup>`5`</sup>
-   `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

#### Follow up:

-   Could you find an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?

```ts
interface Dictionary {
    [key: string]: number;
}

function minWindow(s: string, t: string): string {
    const chars: Dictionary = Object.create(null);
    const lookFor: Dictionary = Object.create(null);
    let subStr = '';
    let subLen = Infinity;
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < t.length; i++) {
        lookFor[t[i]] = (lookFor[t[i]] || 0) + 1;
        count++;
    }
    for (let left = 0, right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
        chars[s[right]] = (chars[s[right]] || 0) + 1;
        if (lookFor[s[right]] !== undefined) {
            if (chars[s[right]] <= lookFor[s[right]]) {
                count -= 1;
            }
        }
        if (count === 0) {
            while (lookFor[s[left]] === undefined || lookFor[s[left]] < chars[s[left]]) {
                chars[s[left]] -= 1;
                left += 1;
            }
            if (right - left + 1 < subLen) {
                subLen = right - left + 1;
                subStr = s.slice(left, right + 1);
            }
            chars[s[left]] -= 1;
            left += 1;
            count += 1;
        }
    }
    return subStr;
}
```
